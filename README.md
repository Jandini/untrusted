# Getting Started with **Untrusted**

### What is *Untrusted*?

*Untrusted* is a **JavaScript puzzle adventure game** where you solve each level by **modifying or adding code**. Your goal is simple: **reach the exit** on every level — but how you do it is up to your code.



### How to Play

1. **Start the Game**  
   - Go to the game screen.  
   - Click the **🔇 speaker icon** in the top-left **game frame** to mute sound.

   - Click inside the game and **press any key** to begin.

2. **Move Your Character**  
   - You are the **green `@` character**.
   - Use **arrow keys** to move:
     - ⬅️ Left ➡️ Right ⬆️ Up ⬇️ Down  
   - Your goal is to **walk to the blue square** (the exit).
   - But first — **pick up the computer** on the map. The "computer" gives you access to the code that builds obsticles on the map.

3. **Understand the Screen**
   - The screen splits into two parts:
     - **Left**: the **map** (gameplay area).
     - **Right**: the **code** that generates the level.

###  How to Win

- Each level is blocked in some way (walls, traps, etc).
- To reach the exit, **you must change the code** that builds the level.
- You’ll do this by **modifying or adding code** in the **black areas**.

---

### Code Rules

- **Red background**: **read-only** code — you can’t change it.
- **Black background**: editable — **change or add code** here freely.
- **Use the comments** at the top of the code — they give helpful hints.

---

### Game Controls

- `Execute` (Ctrl + 5) — runs the code after you modify it.
- `Reset` (Ctrl + 3) — double-click to reset the code to its original state.
- `API` (Ctrl + 1) — shows simple reference documentation (optional in early levels).

You can use mouse click or keyboard short cuts (Ctrl + number key).

### Tips

- Always pick up the **computer** before going to the exit — otherwise, you can’t proceed.
- Don’t worry about fancy JavaScript — the game only uses **simple code and logic**.
- **Think like a puzzle-solver, not a programmer.**

That’s all you need to start.  
**Have fun hacking your way out!**
