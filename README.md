# Getting Started with **Untrusted**

### What is *Untrusted*?

*Untrusted* is a **JavaScript puzzle adventure game** where you solve each level by **modifying or adding code**.
Your goal is simple: **reach the exit** on every level — how you do it is up to your code.

### How to Play

1. **Start the Game**

   * Open the game screen. 
   * Click the **🔇 speaker icon** in the top-left corner of the **game frame** to mute the sound. <img width="675" height="541" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0894b1c8-b9d5-4fac-87e8-417734512a32" />
   * Click inside the game and **press any key** on your keyboard to begin.

2. **Move Your Character**

   * You are the **green `@` character** (the player).
   * Use the **arrow keys** on your **KEYBOARD** to move:
     ⬅️ Left ➡️ Right ⬆️ Up ⬇️ Down
   * Your goal is to **reach the blue square** (the exit).
   * But first, **pick up the computer** on the map. The computer gives you access to the code that generates obstacles on the map.

3. **Understand the Screen**

   * The screen is divided into two parts:

     * **Left**: the **map** (gameplay area).
     * **Right**: the **code** that generates the level.

### How to Win

* Each level contains obstacles (walls, traps, etc.).
* To reach the exit, **you must change the code** that builds the level.
* You’ll do this by **modifying or adding code** in the **black areas**.

---

### Code Rules

* **Red background**: **read-only** code — you can’t change it.
* **Black background**: editable — **change or add code** here freely.
* **Check the comments** at the top of the code — they provide helpful hints.

---

### Game Controls

* `Execute` (Ctrl + 5) — runs the code after you modify it.
* `Reset` (Ctrl + 3) — double-click to reset the code to its original state.
* `API` (Ctrl + 1) — shows a simple reference (optional in early levels).

You can use either mouse clicks or keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl + number key).

### Tips

* Don’t worry about advanced JavaScript — the game only uses **simple code and logic**.
* **Think like a puzzle-solver, not a programmer.**

That’s all you need to get started.
**Have fun hacking your way out!**
